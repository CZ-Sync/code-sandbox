# code-sandbox

Use this repository to put one-off or example code scripts in order to share with others while we work out the project details and vision. Other repositories may ultimately pluck code from this repository and put it more formally in a different one as we converge on research topics and methodologies.

## How to contribute

This is me coding! This contributes to the project by making people smile (maybe).
