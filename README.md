# code-sandbox

Use this repository to put one-off or example code scripts in order to share with others while we work out the project details and vision. Other repositories may ultimately pluck code from this repository and put it more formally in a different one as we converge on research topics and methodologies.

## How to contribute

Please follow these steps to organize your contributions in this sandbox/scratch repo:

1. Make a new folder to house your contributed code. Name it `{firstInitialLastName}_{shorthandTopic}`, e.g. `lplatt_download_prism`.
2. Include a `README.md` inside of your folder to briefly describe the code you are adding and how it is related to the research goals/ideas of the working group so others have context.
3. Add any code/config files needed inside of your folder.
4. Make a PR with your changes (either from a forked repo or from a branch). Since we are using folder names to keep work separate, we should avoid merge conflicts and it should be fine to merge your own PRs. Let's avoid pushing directly to `main`.

Other tips: Try to avoid pushing large data artifacts (only small data files should be included). Image uploads should be OK as long as they aren't huge.
