# This code includes functions for TE implementation, and data processing before TE implementation

# This function calculates the difference between each two time steps in a time series
# Input df: the data frame of time series variables
# Input varname: variable name to process
delta_TS <- function(df,varname){
  # TS at t0
  TS0 <- head(df[[varname]],-1)
  # TS with 1 time step shifted
  TS1 <- tail(df[[varname]],-1)
  # Get the difference
  delta_var <- TS1 - TS0
  return(delta_var)
}
